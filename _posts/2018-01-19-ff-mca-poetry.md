Curated workshops at [Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago](https://mcachicago.org/Calendar/2018/01/Poetry-Is-The-Only-Way-To-Talk-About-What-Hasnt-Happened-Yet).

Inspired by Sean Ward’s Night Bloomers, Compound Yellow in collaboration with Poetry Foundation leads a series of workshops reflecting on Edra Soto’s Open 24 Hours. All experience levels are welcome to join a series of collaborative activities featuring a drawing workshop led by Chicago-based artist Alberto Aguilar, a poetry workshop led by Poetry Foundation Library Coordinator Maggie Queeney, and an instrument-building and sound-making workshop led by multidisciplinary artist Dan Godston.
