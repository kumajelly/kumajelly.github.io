This year I joined the ranks of the top 100 DAP professionals for WalkMe.

I also had the chance to speak about AI and Digital Adoption at the PEX Network All Access event for Digital Adoption.

Some highlights from my interview follows - I oscillated between being a Digital Adoption Specialist and a Learning Designer.

> My first experience with digital adoption was at ArtsConnection, where I worked on a grant program that taught students to use iPads to capture their language learning through art-making. The challenge was instilling confidence in their teachers to adopt the same approach - encouraging them to record and observe progress in their student’s learning.

> When assessing AI and new technologies I try to keep this framework in mind:
> - Enhance: How will this improve existing processes? How is this a benefit to the business?
> - Augment: How does this add new capabilities to current workflows? How will this help the business?
> - Replace: How does this replace current workflows? Is it more efficient? How will this benefit the business?
> The goal of digital adoption isn’t just to speed up workflows or improve efficiency - but to uncover where we can have deeper impact on the business. Be on the hunt for those insights that can lead to opportunities and transformations.

> As a Learning Designer, my focus is on delivering content or messaging, considering whether it’s evergreen or disposable. Much of it tends to be disposable, but I emphasize:
> - Curating: Selecting valuable, lasting content.  
> - Managing: Organizing content for maximum impact.  
> - Facilitating: Empowering learners to create their own materials, which boosts both tool adoption and knowledge retention—similar to project-based learning or handwritten notes.
> These principles also lay the foundation for developing a knowledge base that can easily feed an AI that allows users to self serve knowledge or actions in context.

> Big bets, big impact. Peer-led experiences are often the most impactful. Engaging in conversations about topics you don’t fully understand leads to the most growth.
