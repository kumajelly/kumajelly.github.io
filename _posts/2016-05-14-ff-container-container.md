> Ikebana: The Japanese Discipline of the Art of arranging flowers traces its origin to the 15th century when it began to coalesce into schools. Ikenobo is the oldest school with 550 years of unbroken tradition. Its spiritual base comes from the Senno Kuden or oral tradition. The spiritual link stands firm in the Rokakudo which is a temple on the grounds of its headquarters to this day. 

> The Ikebana practitioner seeks to quietly share in the universal life force during the creation of an arrangement. The brief interaction with live materials is both a meditation and an art which must happen precisely and in one sitting. The beauty of each season is expressed through a vast knowledge of techniques and a firm understanding of a plantâ€™s place in nature.  While many westerners look to the flower in full bloom as an ideal, the Ikebana practitioner sees this as the end of life. Buds, branches, and leaves just beginning to peak out from their origins are sought after as they express the wheel of life.
