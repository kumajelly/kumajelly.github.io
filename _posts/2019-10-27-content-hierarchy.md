*Building scalability and future-proofing into templates has been a focus. I find this helps as a little investment into the Learning and Development department. Breaking templates down into individual components can help others learn what goes where and you can easily collaborate with a SME. But it can also introduce complexity so it needs to strike the right balance. Here, I tried to breakdown how information might be scaffolded within certain content sections of a template. Doing this correctly also requires keeping in mind a catalog of media types that have been used before in the organization.*
