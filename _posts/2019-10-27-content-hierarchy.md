*Building scalability and future-proofing into templates has been a focus. I find this helps as a little investment into the Learning and Development department. Breaking templates down it into individual components can help others learn what goes where and you can easily collaborate with a SME. But it can also introduce complexity so it needs to strike the right balance. Here, I tried to breakdown how the information might be scaffolded within certain content sections of a template.*
