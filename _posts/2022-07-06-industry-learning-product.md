# Industry Learning Product Overview
## Testimonials
- It’s incredibly valuable to have an industry knowledge base that helps us understand our clients and their business in a streamlined, easily consumable bite-sized format.
- The Healthcare & Life Sciences industry content allowed our team to enhance their knowledge and engage clients like experts.

## How it works:
Companies often hire industry-specific experts to add value to their client relationships but struggle to transfer that knowledge to other employees. We create industry-focused programs focusing on imparting specialized foundational knowledge for employees of all levels to understand the industries in which your company specializes, exponentially adding value to your client relationships while building internal industry expertise. 

Our Industry Learning provides a strategy to collect SME knowledge to disseminate throughout your organization.
- **Essentials:** Helps lay the foundation for Industry Learning at the company with high-level information about the what, why, and who. 
- **Customized:** Builds the foundation, then dives deeper into the industry exploring the “how” of the industry and defining subindustries.

We accomplish this by surveying and interviewing SMEs about their industry, identifying specifics about the foundations of the industry and how the company fits into it  and then create  a tactical guide to help others at their company better understand the industry. During the surveys and interviews, Montage also conducts a learning needs analysis to determine the themes and insights that may be missed and define learning gaps then present a learning needs analysis to the client for feedback. We then develop a curriculum and draft modules that are iterated on in collaboration with SMEs to complete them. These modules become the basis for a self-serve knowledge base.

Depending on the need, company, industry, learning platform, and project timeline - Montage creates a full learning experience and may build other solutions to enhance the learning impact like:
- Industry knowledge base - text and minimal graphics (included in Essentials & Customized)
- Quick references (e.g. workbook, job aid PDFs, Slack workflows, etc)
- Short sims that detail real-life scenarios that allow employees role-playing opportunities without pulling from manager resources to facilitate activities (recommended for Customized)
