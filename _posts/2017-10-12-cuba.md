## Oct 3
At Hotel Florida had trouble connecting to wifi - so returned for breakfast at home- then ran out again to the street near El Floridita before leaving for tour. Finally figured out wifi and was able to call Eri just enough time to say “Hello” and run back for tour.
We headed out to Miramar, west to an artist’s house. His name is Jose Fuster. He decorated his house and neighborhood in tiles and shaped concrete.
Afterward, we headed back to Havana to see Afro Cuban “Hamal Alley” - to see art there.

We walked down a few streets discussing architecture, how the inside of houses don’t match the original floor plans - we also saw markets run by government for rationed goods.
Ivan left us to go back to our home. We all took a nap or rest before heading out to Hotel Ambos Mundos for a night cap, the Yankee game and the view.
Hungry, we left grabbed some street food (chips and fritters) and then a quick meal at El Chachullero (tried the lamb, was the best so far)
Then bed.

## Oct 4
Woke up early to speak with Eri - only got 20 minutes in then we were off to Vinales.
First stop along the way was Las Terrazas - a self sustaining community of about 1,000 people helping to rebuild and preserve the land. Started with collaboration with Cuba government and UNESCO.
Ottis was our tour guide we saw preschool and an iced coffee (called Cafe Las Terrazas), learned about the trees, birds, rebuilding land from years of farming, met artist Lester Camp and swam in the river.
We finished our drive to Vinales - met our host family Sandra and Eddie.
We dropped our bags - freshened up with a walk.
Then headed to a local farm that uses a terraced farming system - no pesticides, just using flowers, sweet corn plants to know when insects attacked. The family who owns farm teaches others these methods and helps others in the world. We finished the night with a dinner on the farm - soup of squash/pumpkin, fresh veggies and meat.

Note: Cuban flower - smells like jasmine, Cuba’s tree - royal palm

## Oct 5
Woke up early to chat with Eri - then met with everyone to exchange money
No ordered queue at the bank, everyone sat politely and asked who was next, everyone knew who would be next and there was no arguing
Then we met with our tour guide, Alexis. He guided us through the farms of Vinales - coffee, tobacco (Raoul, his family owned the farm - cigars), and then grabbed a drink just as the rain came down. 
We watched hens fight over territory until the rain stopped
We continued on - heading down and out of the farms
We went back to our rooms to relax before dinner
We headed to a restaurant overlooking the Karster Limestone
We had a cooking lesson by Alianca, a chef at the restaurant “Balcony of the Valley” Balcony del Valle
STUFFED! We headed back to our room in the car - the lights on the street started to turn on and off flickering - blackout.
Get back to sleep with no lights which eventually came back on so we could sleep with air conditioning

## Oct 6
Woke up early and headed towards Cienfuegos
Had lunch at Cafeteria Parakeet along the road
Stopped at an art school called Korimakao - where they allow young people to apply to study art. These young people might come from backgrounds of poverty, social and family issues. They can stay however long they need. We saw demos in music, dance and an art exhibition.
Korimakao - rough meaning, close to the name of hermit crab in Spanish - “carry your home with you always”
We stopped to swim in the Bay of Pigs and then headed to the Museum of Giron to learn about the struggle at the Bay with mercenaries hired by the US
Then we finally arrived in Cienfuegos - a town near a beautiful bay.
Stayed with Lillie and Fel.
Had a nice dinner at MamaParis - on the way back I tried calling Eri but the wifi didn’t work. I walked past the casa and had a taxi guy and his horse follow me until I told him “I’m good.”

Left for Trinidad.
Ivan nows lives here - but his hometown, born/raised in Santa Clara
We settled into our new place with Junior and Glisel

Continuing on we stopped at a government cafeteria for lunch
Finally in Santa Clara we meet Ivan’s mom!
And have a look at Che Guevara’s monument and learn about his important in Santa Clara leading the guerilla’s to victory in the area.
He was captured on Oct 8 in Bolivia and executed on Oct 10. Both are important dates and holidays for Cubans.
Finally, landing in Havana - we say goodbye to Ray (Ranaldo) our driver and settle back into our old digs at Johan’s casa. Freshen up and have a few drinks before having dinner with Ivan and Ozzie for the last time.

## Oct 10
Slept in a little today
Decided on a game plan for the day
> Price out cigars and make an appointment for the “marriage” which is smoking a cigar with coffee and rum
Then found a bank to exchange money - met a nice guy Carlos working at the bank - UP said he learned English from TV
We then returned to the cigar shop to pick up a cigar for tonight’s show
Afterwards we walked the Malecon towards San Francisco de Asia. Grabbed lunch
Then a beer outside - an open porch-like area - I believe government owned too
Then we headed back home for a nap and to freshen up for the night
We then grabbed dinner again at El Chachullero. Excellent, simple food.
The taxi picked us up early for tonight.
We headed to the Nationale Hotel to see the show Cabaret Parisien
Had a drink and cigar before the show - Mark helped some ladies from New York smoke
It was a great show - similar to Tropicana
Grabbed a taxi home and passed out

## Oct 11
Late start today
Headed out around 11am
Shopped along Obisipo
I was hunting for a t-shirt for Eri - something I have seen locals wear - it is a full front printed t-shirt with a female celebrity in a design - usually silkscreened or dye-sublimated, it also has a lace back
We got word that I might be able to find it in Chinatown so we wandered there. No luck.
We headed back towards the Malecon to do the “marriage” of cigars, rum, sugar cane and coffee.
Had lunch at Rest. Cabana then joined a group of tourists for the marriage hosted by Jose Valdes Marquel at Complejo Palacio Artesania
I also found all of Eri’s items at this one shopping center where the cigar shop was located.
Headed back to the room to relax.
Then had a late dinner at our favorite place “El C” tried the fish - awesome.
Headed home - to chat over cigars and beers then sleep
Taxi picking us up tomorrow at 10am
Can’t wait to get home to Eri.
