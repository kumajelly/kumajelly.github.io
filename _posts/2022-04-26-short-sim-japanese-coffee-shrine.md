As a team at Montage we value giving learners autonomy and the opportunity to learn by doing. So we decided to sign up for Clark Aldrich's Short Sims course (my second time).

For this experience, I decided to build a short sim about trying to understand Japanese grammar and how learning it through translation lessens understanding.

Experience the Short Sim here - [Japanese Grammar: Coffee or Shrine](/projects/short-sim-japanese-coffeeshrine/index.html).
