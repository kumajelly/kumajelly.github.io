*Building scalability and future-proofing into templates has been a focus. I find this helps as a little investment into the Learning and Development department. Breaking templates down into individual components can help others learn what goes where and you can easily collaborate with a SME. But it can also introduce complexity so it needs to strike the right balance.*

## Assumptions
*There a few assumptions made here in order to illustrate certain content creation aspects.*
- You already have content
- Your content is near a published state
- You already have a strategy in place to build content

## Tools and systems
- Content hierarchy template
- myTrailhead module + unit template
- Google Doc as toolset (collaboration platform)
- myTrailhead as Learning Experience Platform

## Summarized Flow
SME Request -> Content Audit / Outline -> Content Creation Collaboration -> Content Review / Edit -> Finalize Content -> Published 

## Content Hierarchy Template
*A breakdown of how information might be scaffolded within certain content sections of the myTrailhead module + unit template. Doing this correctly also requires keeping in mind a catalog of media types that have been used before in the organization.*

## myTrailhead Module + Unit Template
*Here both templates are used together as an example laying out content*
