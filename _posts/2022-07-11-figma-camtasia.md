Here are a few examples of walkthroughs created using Figma mockups that Uber's UX Design Team use to demo and prototype features. We worked closely with them to discuss what features are coming for internal and external tools so we can prepare our customer service agents through training.

We typically copied their Figma designs to annotate, adjust, and prototype then screen record and edit in Camtasia.
