Strategic planning is key to achieving a business’s goals. So, why do businesses hastily create band aids to learning problems and not take the time to strategically plan learning programs? We typically see hastily solutioned programs with low learner engagement that quickly become obsolete.  It isn’t that the critical business information is incorrect, it's that the program/solution does not meet the employee’s needs in the right way. 

Montage’s goal for you and your business is for learning to play a vital part of your success. In order to achieve this, we follow our methodology that blends strategic thinking and design thinking to take you on a journey in building a creative, yet effective learning solution. This process is called Design Strategy.

Let’s go on that journey together now:

**Understanding the Mindset**
During initial conversations with you, the aim is to understand the current circumstances and the assumed problem you are facing. Learning about any technical limitations, what solutions may have already been tried and how these speed bumps affect your bottom line.
- Why is it a problem? What is the impact if it isn’t solved?
- What does the current work environment look and feel like?

**Shifting the Mindset**
Once the current situation is understood, we move to uncover the root causes to clearly define the real problem in order to reimagine what is possible. Sometimes the assumed problem is based on an individual's perspective and may not be what is actually occurring throughout the organization. Doing so helps clarify what stands in the way of someone’s goal and what is hindering the business.
- What obstacles or challenges do people face?
- What mistakes do people make?
- How will we measure success after people apply and action knowledge?

**Crafting the Experienc**e
After our research is synthesized and insights are shared, together we can design, plan, and implement a solution that is hyper-focused, clear and efficient, rooted in the defined problem. Our solutions employ learning strategies that target specific learners in order to meet them in their flow of work and keep content relevant. 
- What tasks or steps do people need to take to accomplish this goal?
- What will people be doing once they have successfully implemented their learning?

**Reflecting on the Experience**
Post-launch, we debrief on lessons learned in order to adopt best practices. These debrief sessions occur with project stakeholders, executive sponsors, and also with learners once they complete a solution and have the opportunity to apply new knowledge in their day to day.
- What went well during this project?
- Would this learning content have a positive or negative impact on your company experience?

A Design Strategy based methodology lays out the big picture, looking at the learning solution and measurable goals through the perspective of the learner and the business. Design Strategy can benefit an organization in two ways - it drives internal processes that monitor and evaluate problems as well as identify the solutions that allow your workforce to overcome everyday challenges. Leveraging design strategy gives you the adaptability to confront unique problems at your company and solve for the right problems. Solutions that provide your people with what they need and want.
