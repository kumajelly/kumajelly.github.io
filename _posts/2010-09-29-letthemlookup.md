> bingo cards
torn from b to g
thinking of you
left in the wind
blowing from track to track


> let them look up
> necks and heads dine in
> looking at their dish
> say hello
> to her and you
> let them up over here to you


> we will not carry coals
> to the fire or from the fire
> we will not carry them
> unless the one who asks us
> asks us because they are moving


> whole, whose end is not
> everything that is a shell
> anticipating her whose
> shell is filled with trees
> with trees in fall gray shades


> thinking you know now
> thinking you know does nothing
> until thinking is move
> to move for her in breast
> to move for her in sigh
