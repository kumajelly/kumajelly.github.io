*I recently contributed to The Compound Yellow Manual of Prompts, Provocations, Permissions, and Parameters for Everyday Practices. It is available to download as a PDF from Yellow Compounds website and to purchase as a physical book. Maybe you will find something to do in its pages while staying indoors or for when it is safe again to mingle.* 

*Please find the details below:*


> On the occasion of being invited to participate in the [Hyde Park Art Center's Artists Run Chicago 2.0](https://www.hydeparkart.org/exhibition-archive/artists-run-chicago-2-0/), the experimental art space Compound Yellow produced its first book. The Compound Yellow Manual of Prompts, Provocations, Permissions, and Parameters for Everyday Practices is an edited book that brings together 60 of Compound Yellow's hundreds of affiliates for the first time ever. The book--edited by Jorge Lucero and Laura Shaeffer--is simultaneously a work of scholarship and a work of art, it is curated and emergent, it is about one kind of practice and about hundreds. The book, not unlike Compound Yellow itself, functions as a hub (a place where ideas come in and out of). Some of the contributions are made for contemplation and some of them for activation; all of them are meant for generativity. 300 copies of this collectible artist's book have been produced and are available for advanced purchase on the Compound Yellow website. They are $10 each. Due to the COVID-19 shelter-at-home mandates, books will be mailed out after enough orders have been made (to minimize trips to the post office). All the while the downloadable PDF of the entire book is available for free from this link: [https://compoundyellow.com/#/compound-yellow-manual/](https://compoundyellow.com/#/compound-yellow-manual/) Here's a commercial for the Project: [https://vimeo.com/416480563](https://compoundyellow.com/#/compound-yellow-manual/)
