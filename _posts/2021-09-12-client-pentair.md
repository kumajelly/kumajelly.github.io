We work with Pentair to create an on-the-floor training for their partner's retail employees. Pentair is a manufacturer of pool supplies and machinery. 

**The learning solution constraints were:** 
- 15 minutes of training time before customers come into the store
- Easy to reference guides on down-time
- Tips and tricks with working we customers on-the-floor
- Audience, seasonal (e.g. teenager's summer job) + seasoned employees (e.g. knowledgeable pool supply experts), fewer experts more seasonal workers

**We deployed:**
- Structured and easy to read materials in a Knowledge Base
- Short videos for a deeper, more engaging dive, demonstrating how pool equipment functions and why customers would want to use
- Downloadable PDF Job Aids that capture on-the-floor soft skills like interacting with customers, so they can re-read away from store's main computer

**Example short videos (Camtasia):**
- [Pentair Pumps 101](https://youtu.be/260DZmGVV78)
