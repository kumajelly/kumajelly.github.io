## Still life: When are cut flowers dead?
*Instructor: Sean Ward*

### Course Description
Flower arrangement is an ancient art steeped in tradition, differentiated by culture, and proposes itself as a token of the ephemeral. It is about cultivating a sensitivity to nature and its passing seasons, where a fully bloomed flower is only one of many moments that you can appreciate.

In this course, we will set out to find the ‘ideal image’ of the naturally occurring forms of the plants, trees, and water sources, and to instill it in an arrangement.

Students will use exploratory research methods to investigate the natural surroundings of Ox-Bow, discovering local plant species, observing the landscape, and recording insights through various art mediums like drawing, photography, video, and writing. This research will guide the design of containers built from student chosen materials that can hold and frame a potential arrangement. Students will exchange containers with their fellow students who will then design and produce arrangements sourced from local plant materials. 

Each collaborative container-arrangement will act as a meditation on the landscape applying the learned qualities and principles of arranging from the course. Students will have the opportunity to display their container-arrangement along with their research. Participates will understand and practice a cyclical discipline that is focused on simplicity, reflection, and expression.
