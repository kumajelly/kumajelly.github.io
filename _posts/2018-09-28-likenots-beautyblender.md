Like Nots: beauty blender mirror.

Collaboration with Eri Ichiyanagi 

Play-Doh, paper, pencil

**Instructions:**
Two parts,
- First is the color drawing of the sculptures. Place drawing like a mirror near the floor on the wall with the sculptures setup like they are being reflected.
- Second is a series of drawings to be displayed vertically. Each are a pairing. Doesnâ€™t matter order or hierarchy of pairings.
