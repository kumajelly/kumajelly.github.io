> Dear -,

> I would like to invite you to participate in an exhibition I am organizing at Julius Caesar juliuscaesarchicago.org, an artist-run space in Chicago. I was co-director at Julius Caesar and currently am a consultant to the space. The exhibition will be on Sunday, May 5th, 2013 continuing through the month, with open hours on the weekends.The working title is Reading Room. Similar to the large rooms as that in the New York Public Library Bryant Park, I want to dedicate Caesar's space to the various types of reading- leisure, research, skimming, etc. The space's floor will be covered in various rustic rag rugs for visitors to sit upon, move around, and lounge on. While the books, publications, zines, etc are placed along the perimeter of the wall for visitors to engage with.

> I am asking you to participate. This is based on my own research into what you have been or are doing, or I might have worked with you or spoken to you recently or in the past. And feel you would contribute something significant to this library. What am I asking from you? I am asking for you to contribute books, zines, comics, photo-copied writings, stapled pdfs, any publication in a physical form - but please note I can not guarantee safe return of these items. Think of this as a donation to a public space. I hope to continue this in another space in the future, having the collection grow.

> Every contribution will be represented in the press release - which will take the form similar to that of a table of contents.

> Please let me know ASAP in your participation because I will need to start receiving your publications by the latest, April 15th.

> Contact me if you have any further questions or concerns. Thank you for considering this and I look forward to hearing from you. 

> Best, Sean
