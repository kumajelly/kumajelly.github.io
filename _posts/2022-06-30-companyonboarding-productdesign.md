# Company Onboarding Product Overview
## Testimonials
- The new hire onboarding is so well done. It's thorough and has this personable, friendly approach... It's so great!
- I loved the supporting videos that expounded upon the written content of the trailhead. It helps visual learners, like me, better absorb the material.
- I thought the materials were thoughtfully composed, concise without losing content, and highly authentic.
- I felt like the developer(s) of the training really care about the company and its future.

## How it works
Our onboarding product combines asynchronous and synchronous onboarding experiences with a social learning element. New hires can begin learning about the company their first day using eLearning without the need for HR, manager, or others doing any hand holding. Then within their first month, new hires attend an in-person (remote-friendly) orientation where they meet other new hires, reinforce content from eLearning, and participate in cultural activities. These two components are tied together with a social learning through Slack or other communication tool at the company where new hires can ask questions, help other new hires, and get to know each other.

Montage builds out 3 components that are interwoven to create a great onboarding experience. 
1. **Knowledge Base [eLearning]:** This contains easy to read, informational, and actionable content that new hires consume. It focuses around these main areas: Company’s History and About, Company Culture, Main Systems & Tools (Setup & Basics Resources), Getting Setup (HR Information, HR Setup (e.g. 401k))
2. **Monthly Orientation Presentation [In-Person/Remote]:** This presentation focuses on reinforcing content from the Knowledge Base, company culture emergent, and activities to help new hires settle in. Recommended monthly, depending on your hiring cadence. Presentation typically built-in Google Slides.
3. **Slack or Community Forums [Social Learning]**: A Slack channel or community forum just for new hires is recommended where they can ask questions while navigating the Knowledge Base, getting ramped up in their role, or to ask HR questions. This should be moderated by someone in People Ops or HR. Creating automated polling to check how new hires are doing and a template for new hires to introduce themselves is recommended. This is a great way to maintain contact and build new hires' independence. New hires graduate from this channel or forum after 45 days.

4. In about 10 business days after the resources walkthrough and SME interviews, you will receive a draft of content to be reviewed (some content may be released sooner). Spend up to 5 business days writing up changes and submit them to us.
5. About 5-10 business days after you submit your feedback, you will receive your final onboarding program for final review.

## Onboarding Customer Success Stories
 
### **Salesforce Implementation Partner (SIP) Healthcare and Financial Experts**
A Salesforce Implementation Partner, focused in the healthcare and financial industries, with a majority of remote-only employees, thrived in these fast paced environments and solving complex problems. But this required speed and talent at a rapidly growing company. Onboarding was highly rated but took almost a full week for new hires to complete and it involved multiple teams like human resources, learning and development, and department leaders to run it.  

Helping to rethink their approach, Montage offered insights into optimizing their onboarding systems and strategy. Streamlining processes, gathering information into a knowledge base, and implementing a blended learning approach allowed new hires to discover content on their own and gain company cultural immersion through a monthly orientation. And leveraging a social work platform like Slack, gave new hires a space where they can get answers from each other or anyone.  
Implementing this new onboarding program, helped the company see a week’s onboarding shrink to 9 hours of self-serve learning, increase new hire proficiency by 30% within 30 days, and maintain a 4.8 out of 5 satisfaction rating. And over the first year of the program, the company will see a 134% ROI, essentially cutting the costs of onboarding in half. An easy to maintain program like this allows for scalability at any point in a company’s growth. 

### **Salesforce Implementation Partner (SIP) Construction and Manufacturing Leader** 
A Salesforce Implementation Partner, leader in the construction and manufacturing industry, with remote-only employees, has been experiencing steady growth over 10 years, but suddenly faced a period of rapid growth. This created significant new challenges for their people operations team and it all had to be done at speed. One major issue was onboarding new hires quickly and efficiently so they could become proficient and contribute.
    
Their current onboarding process was long, involved multiple people, and required a hand-holding sequence of check-ins to progress. This took hours of time away from people operations, managers, subject-matter experts, and others. A total of around 30 hours per month and this was all done per individual new hire.

To combat this resource hog, Montage collaborated with them to develop a cost-efficient strategy, relevant content, and an accelerated onboarding process. The solution required a blended learning approach, where new hires take 8 hours of self-serve content and participate in a remote monthly new hire orientation that reviews important information, but also serves as company culture immersion. 

Montage’s solution gave back 30 hours per month per new hire back to those previously involved in the onboarding process. As the company grows the onboarding strategy can scale easily to accommodate the amount of new hires and still allow people operations to focus on new projects to continue making their employees' experience even better. Learners love the autonomy rating their onboarding experience 4.7 out of 5 and in under 2 years the company will see 100% ROI from implementing this new onboarding program.
