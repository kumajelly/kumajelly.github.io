“Dear Lake,
I’ve wrote you a letter, so be still and quiet for this moment- / 
I fear your aqua desire / 
the still surface, in weight / 
you lap like the ocean / 
but together you are / 
nothing / 
your small breasts rise / 
or do you pit / 
I fear you when / 
green leaves grow / 
from the brewed blue / 
it shows me your depths / 
shallow at first / 
then impossibly deep / 
diving, you crack necks / 
at the root we / 
drown / 
I desire fear / 
for you to lure / 
haunted ships, broken bottles / 
luring pinkish flickering / 
nipples in heat / 
hiding your nakedness in / 
sheets / 
I want to drink you

Sincerely, 
Sean

PS I made this for you”
