> “Remember all that dirt we collected during our journey. I took some today, made some mud / clay and decided to patch a hole in the neighborhood. This was my first attempt, and I hope it gets easier. I felt a bit like a vagrant, walking up and down blocks waiting for people to disappear so I could perform. It took me about an hour of walking until the coast was clear and I dropped the mud. It was sticky, thick, lumpy. There wasn't as much as I thought and the cracked sidewalk was larger too. Hopefully, I can get the ratio right. We collected six bags of dirt, some of it is sand, some clay. And they are all of different quantities, different colors, beautiful colors. Stay in the desert so I can mix some concrete to fix the holes in the sand. Arizona mud: Arizona mud (clay) used to fill Chicago's holes.”
