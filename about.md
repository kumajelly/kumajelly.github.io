<p class="lead">Iâ€™m Sean Ward, a learning experience designer.</p>

I currently work as a Learning Experience Designer @Uber.

As a self-directed learner, I seek to introduce non-traditional methods of education. I advocate for collaborative work over fast-paced and helping others. I work to make others feel value through an empathetic, understanding and fair leadership style.
