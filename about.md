<p class="lead">I’m Sean Ward, an experience designer focused on how to engage users to learn, acquire, and enjoy experiences for the long term.</p>

I work as an Instructional Designer at Silverline CRM in New York City. Being a highly visual and experiential learner myself, having felt the pains of numerous bad learning contexts, I am passionate about universal design for learning, accessibility, and plain inclusive language.
