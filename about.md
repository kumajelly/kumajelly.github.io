<p class="lead">Iâ€™m Sean Ward, an experience designer.</p>

I currently work at @Uber.

As a self-directed individual, I seek to introduce human-centered, non-traditional methods of education. I advocate for collaborative work and helping others over move-fast-just-because. I work to make others feel valued through an empathetic, understanding and fair leadership style.
