<p class="lead">Iâ€™m Sean Ward, an artist, experience designer and learning architect.</p>

I currently work at @Montage Learning. I've been working in the creative field for over 15 years and education for over 10 years. My background encompasses designing curricula for nonprofits, workshops for museums spaces, educational exhibits, and multiyear strategies for startups poised for growth.

As a self-directed individual, I focus on human-centered, non-traditional methods of education. I advocate for collaborative work and helping others over move-fast-just-because. I aim to make others feel valued through an empathetic, understanding and fair leadership style.
