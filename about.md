<p class="lead">Iâ€™m Sean Ward, an experience designer focused on how to engage users to acquire, and use for the long term.</a>.</p>

I work as an Instructional Designer at Silverline CRM in New York City. Being a highly visual and experiential learner myself, having felt the pains of numerous bad learning contexts, I am passionate about developing utilizing universal design for learning, accessibility, and plain inclusive language.
